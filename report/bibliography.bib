@misc{Wardman,
  abstract = {The timeliness of phishing incident response is hindered by the need for human verification of whether suspicious URLs are actually phishing sites. This paper presents a method for automating the determination, and demonstrates the effectiveness of this method in reducing the number of suspicious URLs that need human review through a method of comparing new URLs and their associated Web content with previously archived content of confirmed phishing sites. The results can be used to automate shutdown requests, to supplement traditional ldquoURL black listrdquo toolbars allowing blocking of previously unreported URLs, or to indicate dominant phishing site patterns which can be used to prioritize limited investigative resources.},

@article{GroupPolarization,
Abstract = {Experiments exploring the effects of group discussion on attitudes, jury decisions, ethical decisions, judgments, person perceptions, negotiations, and risk taking (other than the choice-dilemmas task) are generally consistent with a "group polarization" hypothesis, derived from the risky-shift literature. Recent attempts to explain the phenomenon fall mostly into 1 of 3 theoretical approaches: (a) group decision rules, especially majority rule (which is contradicted by available data); (b) interpersonal comparisons (for which there is mixed support); and (c) informational influence (for which there is strong support). A conceptual scheme is presented which integrates the latter 2 viewpoints and suggests how attitudes develop in a social context.
